# Veritas

## Inspiration
In early 2015, the New York Times published a Modern Love essay, [“To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This”](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html?_r=0). The essay claimed that a pair of strangers could fall in love after answering 36 questions together.

It went viral. And then a lot of people got nervous.

Imagine this scenario: your partner / wife / boyfriend / summer fling read the article and now wants to talk about the questions on your date tonight. Are you ready to answer?

At Veritas, we make this prospect a little less scary. We provide a space for you to test out your answers with the community first, before having to answer the questions with your partner.

## Technologies Employed

The Veritas app uses a range of technologies.

**Frontend:** HTML + CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, and React.

**Backend:** Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL.

**Testing:** Capybara, Rspec, and Selenium.

## How Veritas Works

**Behind the scenes**
* Questions from the NYT Moden Love Essay are seeded into the database
* Ruby on Rails supports all of the backend and server-side controllers
* Our database has two models (1) Questions and (2) Replies
* The app is designed as a single-page-app, using React and Javascript
* On the client-side we employ a router to maintain the look-and-feel of "real" URLs even though the app all routes to the same page on the back-end

**User Experience**
* Upon loading the page, the user can skim through the questions and select which one he or she would like to answer
* After selecting the question, a submission form pops up were the user can share his or her views.
* The user is also able to skim through other answers given by the community. (Perhaps to judge worthiness of his or her own response!)


## Invitation

Veritas is an open source project, and I'd be thrilled to have any thoughts on additional features that may work well for the site. Say "hi" [on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/andreacoravos)
