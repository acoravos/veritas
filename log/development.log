39:         <p><b>In early 2015</b>, the New York Times published Mandy Len Catron’s Modern Love essay, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html">“To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This”</a>.</p>
40: 
41:         <p> In the essay, Catron refers to a <a href="http://psp.sagepub.com/content/23/4/363.full.pdf+html">study by the psychologist Arthur Aron (and others)</a> that explores whether intimacy between two strangers can be accelerated by having them ask each other a specific series of personal questions. The 36 questions in the study are broken up into three sets, with each set intended to be more probing than the previous one.</p>
42: 
43:         <p><b>Imagine a scenario</b>, now that this article went viral, there is a risk your partner may sit you down and start asking theses questions. Are you ready to answer?</p>
